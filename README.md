Chat Application to get Angular with NodeJS and SocketJS

This can be used as a super simple seed for MEAN Stack + Socket.IO integration.

If you are new to Node.js, Express.js, Angular.js and Socket.io, this can be a good starting point.

It has only the essentials necessary to run an application. No extra injection shabang or template engines... 
Just nitty-gritty bare-bones.
